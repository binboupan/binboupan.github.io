# What is a GSI and why would you want to use one

GSI ROMs are "Generic System Images", meaning they should work with as many devices as possible. There is a project called TrebleDroid, which tries to enable missing functionality on GSI ROMs. For me, I haven't had any issues running GSI ROMs on the Qin F22 Pro, since the hardware on it is pretty standard. I wanted to use a GSI ROM to have a more recent version of Android.



As this phone doesn't come with Google Services it is a nice extra, since you can just install a GSI ROM with Google Services (the sellers selling a F22 Pro with Google Services have tampered with the phone and I would rather do it by myself than trust some random person on the Internet).

# Getting Started

## Required tools
- adb and fastboot
- [MTKClient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient), only if you haven't unlocked your bootloader. To do so, follow my [other guide](https://binboupan.github.io/2023/08/qin-f22-pro/#unlocking-the-bootloader).
- A GSI ROM you would like to use, here is [LineageOS 20](https://sourceforge.net/projects/andyyan-gsi/files/lineage-20-td/) for reference. **ALWAYS** download the arm64 build, not the a64 one! I picked the bgN variant, since it comes with google services and does **not** have root.
- Stock boot image without any modifications (eg. Magisk). The way it came from the factory or just unpatch first :)

## Enabling USB debugging

Make sure you have [unlocked the bootloader](https://binboupan.github.io/2023/08/qin-f22-pro/) before proceeding.

First you need to enable developer mode for the phone. Go to **Settings -> About Phone** and tap on "Build number" a few times.
Afterwards, go to **Settings -> System -> Developer options** and enable "Turn on USB debugging".

In terminal/command prompt run:
```
adb devices

```

Accept the connection on your phone. It should say "device", not "unauthorized" when you run *adb devices*.


## Rebooting to fastboot mode 
In terminal/command prompt run:
```
adb reboot fastboot
```

## Installing the GSI ROM

It is time for us to flash the ROM. We also need to wipe the system partition. Run:
```
fastboot erase system
```

Now we flash the ROM image:
>**<font size=2><span style="color: yellow">⚠</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:red">Make sure to extract the ROM image first, so it has a .img extension, not xz!</span></font>**
```
fastboot flash system lineage-20.0-20231214-UNOFFICIAL-arm64_bgN.img
```

Lastly, we wipe user data and restart the phone:
```
fastboot -w
fastboot reboot
```


After rebooting the phone you should be running LineageOS 20!

Now, you might notice that networking is not working! To fix this run:
```
adb shell settings put global restricted_networking_mode 0
```

The phone still doesn't have a T9 keyboard, so I recommend you to install [Traditional T9](https://github.com/sspanak/tt9/releases).

If the phone complains about Google Play certification, [register the phone manually](https://www.google.com/android/uncertified/?pli=1).
